It unfolds as a narrative of a relationship abundant in friendship and love, yet also fraught with tensions and the ever-present fear of loss. Contained within a petite A5-sized booklet, these images form an intimate story, nestled in a box for added emphasis on the personal nature of the narrative. The deliberate choice of this small format invites viewers to engage closely with the imagery. The design of the booklet is purposeful, featuring photos that span across adjacent pages, with each image partially revealed on one page and seamlessly continuing on the next. This intentional layout mirrors the interconnectedness of the entire series, underscoring that it is a singular, cohesive story. When viewed individually, each photo stands alone; however, experiencing them together reveals a unified narrative that transcends the sum of its parts. </p></div><div class="basis-1/2"><img class="h-auto" src="'+s+'"></div></div>',1),n=[i],c={__name:"WijgijeniksamenView",setup(o){return(r,l)=>(e(),t("main",null,n))}};export{c as default};
