It’s an inexplicable sensation, a kind of mental short circuit. Stepping into this realm feels like entering another world, where everything around me momentarily ceases to exist. Everything appears hazy and unfamiliar in this space. Verbally expressing emotions has always been challenging for me, prompting my quest to investigate how visuals can lend meaning to unarticulated sentiments. To kickstart this exploration, I began compiling a list for myself, pondering the question: ‘the feeling feels like.’ Through this list, I started creating visuals. Simultaneously, by intentionally creating images without a predefined scenario, I found descriptions emerging organically about ‘the feeling.’ Actively seeking stimuli that trigger this emotion, I delved into experimenting with cameras, editing, and sound. For instance, I ventured into creating my own sounds/music using GarageBand. The amalgamation of these elements resulted in an experimental film associating images and sounds with emotions, all rooted in raw feeling. The primary aim of this research is to shed light on mental well-being, a facet I believe is still underestimated and often viewed as a sign of weakness or shame. I aspire to raise awareness about its existence and encourage open conversations. Additionally, I aim to prompt my audience to contemplate and explore personalized ways of expressing emotions, encouraging a form of self-therapy. Expressing feelings is not a sign of weakness or shame. Through this experimental film, my intention is not to make ‘the feeling’ disappear or resolve. Instead, I’ve come to understand and accept ‘the feeling,’ acknowledging that it’s okay to occasionally feel less than stellar. I invite you to step into ‘the feeling’ and reflect on which images resonate with you, what triggers your emotions, and what you feel. </p></div><div class="basis-1/2"></div></div>',1),a=[n],g={__name:"IkVoelView",setup(s){return(o,l)=>(e(),t("main",null,a))}};export{g as default};
