The idea revolves around the desire for moments when we want to immerse ourselves fully in our own world, independent of others. These moments of solitude and isolation are universal and often present in our daily lives, sometimes unconsciously. The strategy behind this series is based on the principle of ‘photographing without overthinking.’ With my analog point-and-shoot camera always at hand, I immediately capture instances of self-reflection as they arise, both in myself and in my immediate surroundings. The images are raw, quick, and perhaps even somewhat voyeuristic, capturing the essence of these everyday, recognizable experiences. The project explores the habit of unconsciously claiming a moment for ourselves, whether consciously or unconsciously choosing to sit apart, entering our own world, and fulfilling this need daily.
